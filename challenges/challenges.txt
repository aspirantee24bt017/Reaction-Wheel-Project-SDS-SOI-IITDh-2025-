Key Challenges in the Reaction Wheel Project

1.  Untuned PID Constants
    -   Kp, Ki, and Kd values are currently arbitrary due to lack of a
        physical setup for proper tuning.

2.  Oversized PCB
    -   Current size: 11.8 x 11.9 cm; exceeds the 10 x 10 cm CubeSat
        target.

3.  Geometrical Misalignment
    -   One axis of the 10 x 10 x 22 cm CubeSat is slightly off due to
        tight spatial constraints.

These are the key problems we faced during the execution of our reaction
wheel project.
